<b>Clothed Murderers</b> puts the default clothing back on murderer NPCs, after it was removed in the December 5, 2019 update. This plugin does not spawn murderers or alter their behavior in any way.

<b>Note:</b> The skins used do not come bundled with the game files, but should download automatically. If a player has any issues downloading these, the standard skins will show instead. I have no control over this, and cannot fix it.
